# Sleep Disorder Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
Sleep disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent, impacting millions of people worldwide. This project provides a **data-driven analysis** of sleep disorders by examining key factors such as **sleep duration, stress levels, BMI, physical activity, and heart rate**. 

The **Sleep Disorder Analysis Dashboard** visualizes these insights, helping to identify trends and patterns in sleep behavior. The goal is to offer actionable insights for individuals, healthcare professionals, and researchers looking to improve sleep health.

## Key Metrics
This dashboard tracks the following key metrics:
- **Total Patients**: 374  
- **Average Age**: 42.18 years  
- **Average Sleep Duration**: 7.13 hours  
- **Total Daily Steps**: 3 million  
- **Disorder Prevalence**: 41.44%  

## Data Analysis

### **1. Physical Activity & Sleep Disorders**
- Patients with sleep disorders, especially insomnia, tend to have fewer daily steps.
- A decline in physical activity is associated with **higher stress levels**, which might worsen sleep disorders.

### **2. Stress & Sleep Quality**
- There is a noticeable **inverse relationship** between stress levels and sleep quality.
- Higher stress levels **correlate with reduced sleep duration** and **poorer sleep quality**.
- Patients with **sleep apnea** tend to report higher stress levels compared to those without sleep disorders.

### **3. Gender & Age-Based Insights**
- Women report slightly higher rates of **insomnia**, whereas men are more likely to experience **sleep apnea**.
- The prevalence of sleep disorders increases with age, highlighting the need for **age-specific interventions**.

### **4. Heart Rate & Stress**
- Patients with higher stress levels tend to have **higher average heart rates**.
- This suggests a link between sleep disorders and **cardiovascular health risks**.

### **5. BMI & Sleep Disorders**
- Overweight and obese patients are more likely to experience **sleep apnea**.
- Normal-weight individuals have a lower prevalence of sleep disorders, reinforcing the role of weight management in improving sleep health.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

üîπ **Encourage Physical Activity**: Patients with lower daily steps tend to experience **worse sleep quality**. Regular physical activity can improve sleep patterns.  

üîπ **Stress Management**: Implementing stress reduction techniques such as **meditation, exercise, and better work-life balance** may improve sleep quality.  

üîπ **Weight Management**: Obese individuals are at a **higher risk** of developing sleep disorders. Promoting **healthy eating habits and weight management programs** can be beneficial.  

üîπ **Targeted Health Interventions**: Gender and age-specific recommendations can help **personalize sleep disorder treatments** for different demographics.  

üîπ **Monitor Heart Health**: Patients with persistent sleep disorders should **track their heart rate** and seek medical advice if elevated heart rates persist.  

## Conclusion
The **Sleep Disorder Analysis Dashboard** provides valuable insights into **how sleep disorders relate to physical activity, stress, BMI, and heart health**. By leveraging these insights, individuals and healthcare professionals can make informed decisions to **improve sleep quality and overall well-being**.
